This repository contains a collection of my Data Science assignments, covering various topics such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling,
machine learning algorithms, and data visualization. Each assignment demonstrates practical applications of data science techniques using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy,
Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. To run the code, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
